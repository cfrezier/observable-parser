= observable-parser

This tool wants to ease observable definition lookup by drawing a map of
all observables in your application.

== Requirements
As it is based on typescript compiler, your project files must be written in typescript.
As of now, I mostly tested it with Angular projects (with Ngrx).

== How to use

- First get dependencies:
`npm install`

- Simple exemple:
`./observable-parser.js --d ./my-project-directory > tmp.puml`

- Documentation available at:
`./observable-parser.js --help`
